                <p><strong>About technology</strong><br>
                    E-commerce, the activity of buying or selling of goods and services over the internet, draws on technologies like electronic funds transfer, internet marketing, online transaction processing, automated data collection systems, and more. Such technologies have made the buying/selling process quicker, easier, and far more convenient. <br>
                    E-commerce includes the exchange of data to promote business transactions' financing and payment aspects. It is widely considered to be the sales aspect of E-business as it is a market entry strategy where the company may or may not have a physical presence. In the early days, E-commerce was only limited to emails and phone calls. Fortunately, now, with a single website, anything and everything that a transaction need can be fulfilled online.  <br>
                    E-commerce is a worldwide network. A small business or a local store can open its own web shopwindow and find the world at its doorstep.

                <p>2. The expenses of creating, processing, distributing, storing, and retrieving paper-based information is reduced when businesses switched to e-business.

                    8. It enables people in rural areas and underdeveloped/developing countries to enjoy products and services that are unavailable to them. <br>
                    <br><strong>Negative impacts: </strong><br>

                    2. There is a higher probability of frauds via online payments due to low security and no verification. <br>
                    3.  of awareness of the technology and its potential also leads to poor growth of e-commerce. <br>
                    4. The advertising and the net tend to focus on the better e-commercialization rather than on brands found in the real world which makes people lose their trust in online goods and services. <br>
                    5. Due to the business switching to run via online platform, people tend to become unproductive to work themselves and depend upon computers more and more. <br>
